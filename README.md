# My Game Development Journey 🎮

Hey there! Welcome to my game development playground where I'm learning, experimenting, and building cool stuff.

## What I'm Working With

Currently exploring game development through different engines and tools:
- **Godot** - Love the community and its simplicity. Makes making games even more fun.
- **Unity** - Industry standard, great for learning professional workflows.
- **Custom C++ Engine** - Because sometimes you want to build everything from scratch!

## Games I've Built

I'm working my way through different genres to understand how games tick:

🏓 **Pong** - Started with the classic! Great for learning basic physics, collision detection and adding gameplay juice.

🗡️ **JRPG Prototype** - Just turn-based combat for now, planning to add story systems, and a roguelike system.

🧛 **Mystic Survivors** - Bullet-hell mayhem! Learning about spawning systems, performance optimization and upgrade systems.


## Why This Repo Exists

This is my learning laboratory! Every project here represents:
- New concepts I'm wrapping my head around
- Experiments with different engines and approaches
- Mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned
