# My Game Development Journey 🎮

Hey there! Welcome to my game development playground where I'm learning, experimenting, and building cool stuff with code and creativity.

## What I'm Working With

I'm exploring game development through different engines and tools:
- **Godot** - Love the open-source vibes and its simplicity. Makes making games even more fun.
- **Unity** - Industry standard, great for learning professional workflows.
- **Custom C++ Engine** - Because sometimes you want to build everything from scratch!

## Games I've Built

I'm working my way through different genres to understand how games tick:

🏓 **Pong** - Started with the classic! Great for learning basic physics, collision detection and adding gameplay juice.

🗡️ **JRPG Prototype** - Just turn-based combat for now, planning to add story systems, and all those RPG mechanics I grew up loving.

🧛 **Vampire Survivors Clone** - Bullet-hell mayhem! Learning about spawning systems, performance optimization and upgrade systems.

[🏃 **2D Platformer** - Jump physics, level design, and making movement feel just right.]

## Why This Repo Exists

This is my learning laboratory! Every project here represents:
- New concepts I'm wrapping my head around
- Experiments with different engines and approaches
- Mistakes I've made and lessons I've learned
- Small victories worth celebrating

## My Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing. Each project might not be perfect, but it's a step forward in understanding game development. Some code is messy, some games are incomplete, but every commit is progress!

## Want to Chat?

If you're also learning game development or have feedback on my projects, I'd love to hear from you! Feel free to open an issue or start a discussion.

Happy coding! 🚀
